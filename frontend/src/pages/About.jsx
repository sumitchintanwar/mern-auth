            Hi, I'm Sumit, a passionate developer who loves creating
            clean, efficient, and interactive web applications. I enjoy working
            with modern technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and exploring
            new tools in the development ecosystem. This project is one of my
            learning and portfolio-building initiatives.

          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This project is built using React.js and demonstrates
            component-based architecture, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS, and
            clean code practices. It's designed to showcase my frontend
            development skills and serve as a foundation for more advanced
            features like routing, authentication, and state management in the
            future.
